# Pomodoro of Dev.Fallingstar

## What's this?

This repository is stand for Pomodoro task recording.

Simply, the Pomodoro task follows below rules

1. Work hardly 25 for minutes
2. Take a break hardly 5 for minutes
3. After one big task is over, Take a long break hardly for 30 ~ 60 minutes

Is this working? IDK, just do it.


## What is WTFRUD.md?

It's a short-word for 'What The Fxxx Are You Doing?'.

There's a lot of thing that make you free so you can work or break hardly. I wrote down the tasks what should I do after the Pomodoro task is over, so I can concern only works have to do right now.
